Original was limited to 30 issues per page (as per Github's pagination). Modified to include all issues in a single report.
Tweaks to report format (see sample below).

## Purpose

This simple little tool generates a static HTML report of issues for a Github repo. This is useful if you want to share
the status of issues with someone who doesn't have access to your repo, for example.

## Getting Started

1. Install `npm install -g github-issue-reports`
2. Run `github-issue-reports -o <owner> -r <repo> [-t <access token>]` (access token is required to access private repos)
